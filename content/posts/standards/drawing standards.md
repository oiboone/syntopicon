## paper sizes

ISO 216 - defines A, B, and C series with sqrt(2) ratio between sides.
A0 has area of 1 m^2, B0 has short side of 1 m, and C0 is geometric mean of A0 and B0.

ANSI/ASME Y14.1 - A is 8.5 x 11, B is twice as long, etc.

ANSI/ASME Y14.1M has metric sizes based on the ISO 216 standard.

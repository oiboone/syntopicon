# Introduction

Under most laws, creative works are automatically copyrighted by their creator with all rights reserved. This means that to allow free use of your material, you must explicitly provide a licence that allows the uses you intend.

The Open Source Initiative maintains a list of approved open source licenses. Using one of these instead of creating your own makes it easier for others to use your material since the properties of these licenses are well known.


# Public Domain 

Unlicense
: most permissive, grants all rights to everyone, disclaims warranty

Creative Commons Zero (CC0)
: similar to unlicense. (recommended way to release to public domain)

BSD 0-clause license
: warranty disclaimer from BSD no patent rights grant. Only OSI approved public domain equivalent license.

# Licenses for artistic and educational texts

Creative Commons BY 
: requires attribution

CC BY-SA
: requires attribution and share-alike (open source) Good for artistic and educational works, not for software

# Software Open Source Licenses

## Permissive Licenses

X11 (aka MIT)
:permissive, compatible with GNU, permits use including proprietary use, redistribution, modification. Requires inclusion of copyright notice. Most popular as of 2015. Essentially the same as the 2 clause BSD license. No patent release clause

ISC
: similar to BSD and MIT but removes language unnecessary since Berne Convention

Boost
: similar to BSD and MIT

BSD 3 clause
: adds non-endorsement clause to MIT, does not require share back

BSD 4 clause
: adds requirement that advertising must include acknowledgement

Apache 2.0
: grants patent license for any patents the creator might have on the software and terminates license if patent violation claims made.

Academic Freedom
: similar to Apache 2.0

## Strong Copyleft Licenses

GPL 2 
: requires shareback of modified source, limits what can be distributed with software

GPL 3
: prevents tivoization

Gnu Affero GPL (AGPL)
: modification of GPL to deal with software as a service, where software is run on a server without being distributed. So rights extend to those using software over a network. FOr example, modified versions that are made available online but not redistributed must still remain open source.

## Weak Copyleft

LGPL
: Lesser or library general public license - less restrictive than gpl allows use in proprietary products but covered software must be modifiable. A compromise between BSD and GPL intended for libraries that would be linked to proprietary programs.

Mozilla 2.0 (MPL 2.0)
: like apache license but source must be disclosed. MPL 2.0 is considered to be GPL compatible but earlier versions are not. Allows forward migration of a licence in that users may choose to use it under any future version of the license if they prefer.

CDDL (Common Development and DIstribution Licence)
: License created by Sun Microsystems which may be intentionally incompatible with GPL.

## Other

SIL Open Font License
: keeps font open source but allows use of font in other creations.

GFDL
: Similar to creative commons BY-SA except that it allows for Invariant sections that may not be modified and prohibiting use of DRM to prevent copying.

Intel
: identical to BSD with addition of reminder regarding US export laws.

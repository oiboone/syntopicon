# Overview

Students often look for recommendaitons for software for various purposes. In order to reply quickly, I find it useful to have a list of software that I would recommend for a variety of purposes.

In order to make such a list, it is useful to have a set of uniform criteria for high quality software.

# Open Source

Open source software is preferred so that an interested user can examine the source and if needed, modify it to fit their purposes.

A wide variety of open source liceses exist. In general, if all else is equal, prefer a more liberal license to a more restrictive one. For example, CC0 is less restrictive than MIT and BSD licenses, which are less restrictive than GPL 2.0.

# Cross-Platform

Since students are likely to use both Windows and Mac OS machines, recomende software should ideally run similarly on OSX, Windows, and Linux

# Use of Open File Formats

Ideally, in addition to being open source, software should be able to read and store data in open formats. These are file formats that are clearly documented so that it is possible to write code to read and write them. They do not have "hidden features" that can only be used by some vendors.

# Quality of features

Sometimes there is no open source program that matches the quality of proprietary software. In this case, proprietary software might be chosen if it can read and write an open file format.

# Ease of Use

# High probability of support

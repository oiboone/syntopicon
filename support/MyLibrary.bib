  title = {Estimation of Measurement Uncertainties - an Alternative to the {{ISO Guide}}},
  volume = {38},
  abstract = {The procedure for uncertainty assessment set out in the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement, published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), is compared with an alternative system. The ISO Guide links the overall uncertainty to a so-called kP factor, implicitly expressing the degree of confidence that the measured result should cover the true value of the physical quantity in question. Here it is argued that this standard procedure, in which the magnitude of a given kp factor is tied to the degree of confidence, presents the experimenter with difficulties. These arise from the need to associate a probability density with so-called unknown systematic errors. Consequently, the recommended procedures may not be taken up by experimenters who carry out laboratory measurements on a daily basis. A simplification of the ISO procedure suggested by the Guide involves the assignment of the values 1 or 2 (or even 3) to kP. The alternative approach presented here argues that this simplification does not reflect the prevailing physical situation, and that the degree of confidence obtained lacks physical objectivity. Stationary measurement processes, strictly separating random and unknown systematic errors, are considered. Random errors are assumed to be normally distributed, and no probability distribution density is attributed to the unknown systematic errors. As random and systematic errors are kept separate, it is possible to express the influence of random errors by generalized confidence intervals (from Student's t-distribution) and the influence of systematic errors by worst-case estimates. No confidence statement is associated with the overall uncertainties, and the intrinsic problem of the Guide is circumvented. The formalisms are robust, transparent, and locate measured quantities with reasonable reliability.},

  abstract = {The Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) is the internationally accepted master document for the evaluation of uncertainty. It contains a procedure that is suitable for many, but not all, uncertainty evaluation problems met in practice. This procedure constitutes an approximation to the general solution of the Markov formula, which infers the probability density function (PDF) for the output quantities (measurands) from the model of the measurement and the PDFs for the input quantities. This paper shows that a Monte Carlo method is an effective and versatile tool for determining the PDF for the measurands. This method provides a consistent Bayesian approach to the evaluation of uncertainty. Although in principle straightforward, some care is required in representing and validating the results obtained using the method. The paper provides guidance on optimizing the approach, identifies some pitfalls and indicates means for validating the results.},

The decision process in an artificial neural network is based on certain nonlinear operations. Such nonlinearities are useful: i) in improving the convergence speed (of the algorithm); ii) to provide more general nonlinear mapping between input-output signals; and iii) to reduce the effect of outliers in the measurements. One of the most successful artificial neural networks is the so-called feed forward neural network. In this chapter first the description of the feed forward neural network and its training algorithms is given. Next, parameter estimation using this approach is discussed. The presentation of training algorithms is such that it facilitates MATLAB implementation. Subsequently, recurrent neural networks are described. Several schemes based on recurrent neural networks are presented for parameter estimation of dynamical systems. Subsequently, the genetic algorithm is described and its application to parameter estimation considered.},

  abstract = {A practical, transparent and accurate procedure is proposed for the evaluation of measurement uncertainty. The procedure is based on established statistical theory, allows the treatment of correlated input quantities estimated from a finite number of observations and permits the assignment of asymmetric distributions to input quantities. The procedure is applicable wherever the basic method of clause 8 of the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (the Guide ) is applicable. As in the method of the Guide , distributions are associated with input quantities for use with a linearized formulation of the measurement function. These distributions are combined using a property of their statistical cumulants, which are simple functions of their moments. The distribution ultimately obtained for the measurand is a member of the Pearson family, which has the set of scaled t -distributions as a subset. So the procedure allows greater flexibility than the method of the Guide in the representation of the distribution associated with the measurand. The procedure has the qualities of internal consistency and transferability as outlined in clause 0.4 of the Guide and is consistent with principles of the 'propagation of distributions' that underlie a proposed supplement to the Guide . In many cases it will permit the quotation of uncertainty intervals that are narrower than those of the Guide yet with the same justifiable probability of containing the measurand, so providing a more informative statement to the user of the interval. The procedure is presented for the probabilities of 0.95 and 0.99 but can be extended to accommodate other probabilities.},

  title = {Measurand: A Cornerstone Concept in Metrology},
  volume = {45},
  abstract = {This paper proposes to discuss some concepts whose importance is fundamental to any theory of measurement. From the epistemological point of view there is a very significant inconsistency in the concept of measurand contained in the GUM. According to the model adopted by the GUM, a particular measurand remains the same measurand after a change in its definition, notwithstanding the fact that new conditions had been included or other pre-existing conditions had been altered in the definition. And also notwithstanding the very probable fact that, in consequence, the uncertainty component associated with its definition had been changed. The problem that arises from this theoretical model is that a particular measurand is not completely characterized by a precise and unique definition. Instead, it is considered an 'ideal' utopian particular concept to which would converge a specific series of 'measurands' (more properly their definitions), continually redefined in an infinite succession. Such a theoretical basis seems very inappropriate: the model intends to determine the uncertainty of uncertainly defined particular measurands. Of great relevance is the proposal of a new definition for the concept of measurand, a concept that interfaces the realms of Metrology and experimentation. Other concepts have been created or redefined with sufficient precision and selectivity to consider some aspects that remain somewhat confused in the model of measurement currently applied.},

In this paper the issue is discussed, and it is shown that the second approach is inconsistent with the GUM framework. However, it is indeed preferable for input quantities having an intrinsically random behaviour. We comment on the approach adopted in this respect in Supplement 1 of the GUM and show that it is consistent with the first method.},

Student responses to written probes administered at the beginning of the year are compared to those written after a 12 week laboratory course.

At the heart of the point paradigm is that both action and reasoning are based solely on individual measurements in a data set. On the other hand, subscribing to the set paradigm implies an understanding that a series of measurements are to be viewed as a collective that can be modelled by theoretical constructs, such as the mean and standard deviation. The degree of consistent use of these paradigms by individual students across the sets of probes is investigated. Implications for effective teaching interventions in the physics laboratory are discussed.},

The value of the output quantity yielded by a model is evidently influenced by errors in the determination of the input quantities. Therefore, the uncertainties of the output data can be expressed in terms of the uncertainties of the input quantities by using a Monte Carlo-based uncertainty propagation technique. As an example, we evaluated the uncertainty of the spectral UV irradiance rendered by a radiative transfer model under cloudless sky conditions. This model allows calculation of the spectrally resolved solar UV irradiance from some set of measured input quantities linked with the concentration of atmospheric constituents, the surface reflectivity as well as the spectral characteristics of the aerosol modulation. Although only a single model was used in this work, the methodology applied to evaluate the uncertainty is general and can be applied to any other computational model.},

Observation constitutes the transformations involved in producing the observable output.

After providing a probabilistic representation of the observation sub-process, we derive appropriate formulae for addressing restitution and describing the overall measurement process. The model allows the treatment in probabilistic terms of both the random and systematic effects that influence the measurement process, and may prove particularly useful in the formulation phase of uncertainty evaluation. We also discuss the different ways in which the measurand can be characterized by a probability distribution, and demonstrate the application of the approach to the analysis of risk in conformance testing.},

This paper discusses an approach to uncertainty evaluation for calibration of line scales amenable for application of MC methods. The model for the measurement uncertainty in line scale calibration is interpreted from the perspective of the line-scale user, namely a distance measurement between any two intervals of the line scale. For this purpose, the introduction of a consensus invariant assigned in an alternative interpretation of the data can also expedite international comparison analysis. The proposed method is illustrated using a practical real-world example from an international comparison of calibration of line scales.},

Various formal settings, including but not restricted to fuzzy sets and possibility measures, have been proposed, based on different intuitions, and dealing with various kinds of uncertain data. The two main research directions are upper and lower probabilities which convey the idea of imprecisely estimated probability measures, and distorted probabilities for the descriptive assessment of partial belief. Possibility measures, and thereby fuzzy sets, stand at the crossroads of these new approaches. Traditional views, interpretive settings and canonical experiments for the measurement of probability such as frequentist approaches, betting theories, comparative uncertainty relations are currently extended to the generalized uncertainty measures. These works shed new light on various interpretations of fuzzy sets and clarify their links with probability theory; conversely Zadeh's logical point of view on fuzzy sets suggests a set-theoretic perspective on uncertainty measures, that brings together numerical quantification and logic."},

  abstract = {The Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) applies to the generic situation that a model is available which relates the quantity of interest to input quantities and that information on the input quantities is given in terms of estimates and uncertainties. Within this framework, the GUM specifies how to calculate an estimate of the quantity of interest and the uncertainty associated with this estimate as well as a coverage interval for the quantity according to a stipulated coverage probability. In this paper the case is considered that additional prior knowledge about the quantity of interest is available. For instance, the quantity of interest could be known to be positive or some prior estimate and its associated uncertainty may be given. This case is treated using probability density functions which encode the information on the input quantities as well as the prior knowledge about the quantity of interest. In general, numerical techniques have to be employed and an easy-to-apply Monte Carlo method is proposed. For the particular case of a linear (or linearized) model relation and Gaussian probability density functions an analytic solution is derived and discussed. Finally, the proposed treatment, its numerical implementation and the possible benefit of taking into account prior knowledge are illustrated by an example.},

A concept of dynamic measurement uncertainty is introduced by generalizing the GUM approach. The concept is applied to linear and time-invariant systems which are often appropriate to model dynamic measurements. Digital filtering is proposed for estimating the time-dependent value of the measurand and the design of an appropriate FIR filter is described. Dynamic uncertainty evaluation is then carried out for this analysis and conditions are specified for its proper use. The approach is illustrated for the particular example of a second-order model. It is shown in terms of simulations that the proposed analysis yields significantly improved results when compared with the sometimes applied quasi-static treatment.},

  volume = {46},
  abstract = {A recent supplement to the GUM (GUM S1) is compared with a Bayesian analysis in terms of a particular task of data analysis, one where no prior knowledge of the measurand is presumed. For the Bayesian analysis, an improper prior density on the measurand is employed. It is shown that both approaches yield the same results when the measurand depends linearly on the input quantities, but generally different results otherwise. This difference is shown to be not a conceptual one, but due to the fact that the two methods correspond to Bayesian analysis under different parametrizations, with ignorance of the measurand expressed by a non-informative prior on a different parameter. The use of the improper prior for the measurand itself may result in an improper posterior probability density function (PDF) when the measurand depends non-linearly on the input quantities. On the other hand, the PDF of the measurand derived by the GUM supplement method is always proper but may sometimes have undesirable properties such as non-existence of moments. It is concluded that for a linear model both analyses can safely be applied. For a non-linear model, the GUM supplement approach may be preferred over a Bayesian analysis using a constant prior on the measurand. But since in this case the GUM S1 PDF may also have undesirable properties, and as often some prior knowledge about the measurand may be established, metrologists are strongly encouraged to express this prior knowledge in terms of a proper PDF which can then be included in a Bayesian analysis. The results of this paper are illustrated by an example of a simple non-linear model.},

Generally, decisions are taken by comparing data coming from the field with each other or with a given threshold. The problem is that experimental data, collected as the results of a measurement activity, are affected by uncertainty, and therefore the comparison cannot be performed as a simple comparison between two scalar values, but should also take into account the measurement uncertainty. In fact, neglecting measurement uncertainty could lead to decisions that might be dramatically wrong. The problem of decision making in the presence of measurement uncertainty is very often neglected, or approached in a probabilistic way.

The practice today, which is reflected in the reference standard provided by the IEC-ISO "Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement," adopts a statistical approach for the expression and estimation of the uncertainty, since the probability theory is the most known and used mathematical tool to deal with distributions of values. However, the probability theory is not the only tool to deal with distributions of values and is not the most suitable one when the values do not distribute in a totally random way. In this case, a more general theory, the theory of the evidence, should be considered. This paper recalls the fundamentals of the theory of the evidence and frames the random-fuzzy variables within this theory, showing how they can usefully be employed to represent the result of a measurement together with its associated uncertainty. The mathematics is defined on the random-fuzzy variables, so that the uncertainty can be processed, and simple examples are given.},

Since well-justified and unique measures of uncertainty (and information) are now well established in both probability theory and possibility theory, the transformations are well defined. Mathematical properties of the transformations are analyzed in the paper under the assumption that probabilities and possibilities are connected via interval or log-interval scales. The primary results are: (i) the interval scale transformation that preserves information exists and is unique only from probability theory to possibility theory, but the inverse transformation does not always exist; (ii) the log-interval scale transformation exists and is unique in both directions; and (iii) the log-interval scale transformation satisfies the probability-possibility consistency requirement.},

  volume = {38},
  abstract = {The procedure for uncertainty assessment set out in the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement, published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), is compared with an alternative system. The ISO Guide links the overall uncertainty to a so-called kP factor, implicitly expressing the degree of confidence that the measured result should cover the true value of the physical quantity in question. Here it is argued that this standard procedure, in which the magnitude of a given kp factor is tied to the degree of confidence, presents the experimenter with difficulties. These arise from the need to associate a probability density with so-called unknown systematic errors. Consequently, the recommended procedures may not be taken up by experimenters who carry out laboratory measurements on a daily basis. A simplification of the ISO procedure suggested by the Guide involves the assignment of the values 1 or 2 (or even 3) to kP. The alternative approach presented here argues that this simplification does not reflect the prevailing physical situation, and that the degree of confidence obtained lacks physical objectivity. Stationary measurement processes, strictly separating random and unknown systematic errors, are considered. Random errors are assumed to be normally distributed, and no probability distribution density is attributed to the unknown systematic errors. As random and systematic errors are kept separate, it is possible to express the influence of random errors by generalized confidence intervals (from Student's t-distribution) and the influence of systematic errors by worst-case estimates. No confidence statement is associated with the overall uncertainties, and the intrinsic problem of the Guide is circumvented. The formalisms are robust, transparent, and locate measured quantities with reasonable reliability.},

  abstract = {The critical nature of health care demands high performance levels from medical equipment. To ensure these performance levels are maintained, medical physicists and biomedical engineers conduct a range of measurements on equipment during acceptance testing and on-going quality assurance programs. Wherever there are measurements, there are measurement uncertainties with potential conflicts between the measurements made by installers, owners and occasionally regulators. Prior to 1993, various methods were used to calculate and report measurement uncertainties. In 1993, the International Organization for Standardization published the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM). The document was jointly published with six international organizations principally involved in measurements and standards. The GUM is regarded as an international benchmark on how measurement uncertainty should be calculated and reported. Despite the critical nature of these measurements, there has not been widespread use of the GUM by medical physicists and biomedical engineers. This may be due to the complexity of the GUM. Some organisations have published guidance on the GUM tailored to specific measurement disciplines. This paper presents the philosophy behind the GUM, and demonstrates, with a medical physics measurement example, how the GUM recommends uncertainties be calculated and reported.},

  volume = {44},
  abstract = {This paper presents an approach for making inference on the parameters {\^I}\textonequarter{} and {\"I}$f$ of a Gaussian distribution in the presence of resolution errors. The approach is based on the principle of fiducial inference and requires a Monte Carlo method for computing uncertainty intervals. A small simulation study is carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed procedure and compare it with some of the existing procedures. The results indicate that the fiducial procedure is comparable to the best of the competing procedures for inference on {\^I}\textonequarter. However, unlike some of the competing procedures, the same Monte Carlo calculations also provide inference for {\"I}$f$ and many other related quantities of interest.},

The H-distribution is derived: the frequency function is symmetric about zero, with central ordinate \$(1/$\backslash$pi)$\backslash$sqrt(1 - n\^-1)\$; asymptotically it is normal, \$N(0, $\backslash$sqrt($\backslash$pi/2))\$. An approximate formula for the calculation of the percent values is developed and numerical factors tabulated by which the mean absolute deviation of a normal sample of size n is to be multiplied in order to obtain 95 percent and 50 percent confidence limits of the mean, for n = 2(1)15(5)30, 40, 60, 120. It is shown that the increase in length against confidence intervals from the standard deviation and Student's t is negligible. The usefulness of confidence intervals from the mean absolute deviation for estimating the precision of measurements in Physics is discussed.},

  title = {On Use of {{Bayesian}} Statistics to Make the {{Guide}} to the {{Expression}} of {{Uncertainty}} in {{Measurement}} Consistent},
  volume = {40},
  abstract = {The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement is being increasingly recognized as a de facto international standard. The ISO Guide recommends a standardized way of expressing uncertainty in all kinds of measurements and provides a comprehensive approach for combining information to evaluate that uncertainty. The ISO Guide supports uncertainties evaluated from statistical methods, Type A, and uncertainties determined by other means, Type B. The ISO Guide recommends classical (frequentist) statistics for evaluating the Type A components of uncertainty; but it interprets the combined uncertainty from a Bayesian viewpoint. This is inconsistent. In order to overcome this inconsistency, we suggest that all Type A uncertainties should be evaluated through a Bayesian approach. It turns out that the estimates from a classical statistical analysis are either equal or approximately equal to the corresponding estimates from a Bayesian analysis with non-informative prior probability distributions. So the classical (frequentist) estimates may be used provided they are interpreted from the Bayesian viewpoint. The procedure of the ISO Guide for evaluating the combined uncertainty is to propagate the uncertainties associated with the input quantities. This procedure does not yield a complete specification of the distribution represented by the result of measurement and its associated combined standard uncertainty. So the correct coverage factor for a desired coverage probability of an expanded uncertainty interval cannot always be determined. Nonetheless, the ISO Guide suggests that the coverage factor may be computed by assuming that the distribution represented by the result of measurement and its associated standard uncertainty is a normal distribution or a scaled-and-shifted t -distribution with degrees of freedom determined from the Welch\textendash{}Satterthwaite formula. This assumption may be unjustified and the coverage factor so determined may be incorrect. A popular convention is to set the coverage factor as 2. When the distribution represented by the result of measurement and its associated standard uncertainty is not completely determined, the 2-standard-uncertainty interval may be interpreted in terms of its minimum coverage probability for an applicable class of probability distributions.},

  title = {Bayesian Alternative to the {{ISO}}-{{GUM}}'s Use of the {{Welch}}\textendash{}{{Satterthwaite}} Formula},
  volume = {43},
  abstract = {In certain disciplines, uncertainty is traditionally expressed as an interval about an estimate for the value of the measurand. Development of such uncertainty intervals with a stated coverage probability based on the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) requires a description of the probability distribution for the value of the measurand. The ISO-GUM propagates the estimates and their associated standard uncertainties for various input quantities through a linear approximation of the measurement equation to determine an estimate and its associated standard uncertainty for the value of the measurand. This procedure does not yield a probability distribution for the value of the measurand. The ISO-GUM suggests that under certain conditions motivated by the central limit theorem the distribution for the value of the measurand may be approximated by a scaled-and-shifted t -distribution with effective degrees of freedom obtained from the Welch\textendash{}Satterthwaite (W\textendash{}S) formula. The approximate t -distribution may then be used to develop an uncertainty interval with a stated coverage probability for the value of the measurand. We propose an approximate normal distribution based on a Bayesian uncertainty as an alternative to the t -distribution based on the W\textendash{}S formula. A benefit of the approximate normal distribution based on a Bayesian uncertainty is that it greatly simplifies the expression of uncertainty by eliminating altogether the need for calculating effective degrees of freedom from the W\textendash{}S formula. In the special case where the measurand is the difference between two means, each evaluated from statistical analyses of independent normally distributed measurements with unknown and possibly unequal variances, the probability distribution for the value of the measurand is known to be a Behrens\textendash{}Fisher distribution. We compare the performance of the approximate normal distribution based on a Bayesian uncertainty and the approximate t -distribution based on the W\textendash{}S formula with respect to the Behrens\textendash{}Fisher distribution. The approximate normal distribution is simpler and better in this case. A thorough investigation of the relative performance of the two approximate distributions would require comparison for a range of measurement equations by numerical methods.},

  title = {Analytical {{Bias}}: The {{Neglected Component}} of {{Measurement Uncertainty}}},
  volume = {122},
  abstract = {All analysts are accustomed to reporting measurement results accompanied by either the standard deviation of individual results from the mean or the standard error of the mean. These statements indicate repeatability of measurement under unchanged conditions, or reproducibility, where the time period over which measurements are taken is the source of changed conditions. Repeatability generally produces a smaller deviation between replicates than does reproducibility. However, most of the variability of measurements made by different laboratories, or using different methods in a single laboratory, is not accounted for by either repeatability or reproducibility attributable to time period. This is evident in all interlaboratory data sets; these frequently contain between-laboratory and between-method discrepancies that are very large in comparison with the uncertainty of measurements typically reported by individual laboratories. Recently issued ISO guidelines and related documents address these discrepancies as a legitimate component of measurement uncertainty, and recommend expanding the concept to include the deviation of a measurement from the true value of the measurand, so long as this deviation is small relative to fitness for purpose requirements. When the bias of measurement renders the result unsuitable for purpose, however, that bias is a significant effect and must be removed by use of a correction factor. To correct for significant bias, or to include smaller bias as an uncertainty component, laboratories must evaluate and quantify the bias in their measurements to the fullest extent possible. This paper presents uncertainty statements developed in accordance with the ISO guidelines for several reference sample measurements. Some are very complex, drawn from published work of metrology laboratories. Others, drawn from the authors data for the Japanese Sedimentary rock reference materials, are more suitable for routine laboratory use.},

A user of the ISO-GUM who is interested in understanding, managing or improving the measurement procedure needs the details, usually expressed as an uncertainty budget, on how the estimate for the value of the measurand and its associated combined standard uncertainty were calculated. In particular, a user may be interested in quantifying the degrees of contribution to the combined standard uncertainty from its components. When the measurement equation is a linear function of uncorrelated input variables, the contribution from a component is usually quantified by the product of the component of uncertainty and its sensitivity coefficient. This paper introduces a coefficient of contribution that is suitable for both uncorrelated and correlated input variables. The proposed coefficient of contribution is useful for a variety of measurement equations. Correlations between input variables can significantly alter the relative importance of the contributions to the combined standard uncertainty from its components.},

  volume = {49},
  abstract = {Background: The Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) provides instructions for constructing uncertainty intervals for a measurement. This method is usually reserved for reference materials, but GUM has been recently proposed as a way to express uncertainty for commercial diagnostic assays. Methods: Using the official GUM standard and published applications of GUM to commercial diagnostic assays, I undertook an analysis to evaluate whether applying GUM to commercial diagnostic assays is warranted. Results: Certain important assays, such as troponin I, would not be candidates for GUM because troponin I is not a well-defined physical quantity. Unlike definitive methods, in which efforts are taken to detect and eliminate all systematic error sources, commercial assays often trade off features such as ease of use and cost with accuracy and allow systematic errors to be present as long as the overall accuracy meets the medical need goal. Laboratories are hindered in preparing GUM models because the knowledge required to specify some systematic errors is often available only to manufacturers. Some non-GUM methods to estimate uncertainty rely on observed data, which include both known and unknown sources of error. The occurrence of large, unknown errors for assays in routine use (e.g., outliers) is not unusual because diagnostic assays must be chemically specific in the presence of thousands of potentially interfering substances. There is no provision in GUM to deal with unexplained outliers, which may lead to uncertainty intervals that are not wide enough. Some clinicians assume that diagnostic assay results have little uncertainty. This situation may be made worse by including an uncertainty interval, which implies certification. Conclusions: Evaluations for accuracy (total analytical error) based on describing the distribution of result differences between commercial assays and reference methods indicate that some assays have a few results with large differences (e.g., outliers). This leads to a wide accuracy interval (total analytical error limits). It is unlikely that GUM would be able to predict these wide intervals, especially because there is little or no provision for outlier treatment in GUM. Presenting too narrow GUM uncertainty intervals to clinicians would be misleading. The modeling used by practitioners of the GUM method is potentially useful in improving quality, but commercial diagnostic assays are not ready for GUM uncertainty statements.},

  isbn = {0026-1394},
  abstract = {The publication of the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM), and later of its Supplement 1, can be considered to be landmarks in the field of metrology. The second of these documents recommends a general Monte Carlo method for numerically constructing the probability distribution of a measurand given the probability distributions of its input quantities. The output probability distribution can be used to estimate the fixed value of the measurand and to calculate the limits of an interval wherein that value is expected to be found with a given probability. The approach in Supplement 1 is not restricted to linear or linearized models (as is the GUM) but it is limited to a single measurand. In this paper the theory underlying Supplement 1 is re-examined with a view to covering explicit or implicit measurement models that may include any number of output quantities. It is shown that the main elements of the theory are Bayes' theorem, the principles of probability calculus and the rules for constructing prior probability distributions. The focus is on developing an analytical expression for the joint probability distribution of all quantities involved. In practice, most times this expression will have to be integrated numerically to obtain the distribution of the output quantities, but not necessarily by using the Monte Carlo method. It is stressed that all quantities are assumed to have unique values, so their probability distributions are to be interpreted as encoding states of knowledge that are (i) logically consistent with all available information and (ii) conditional on the correctness of the measurement model and on the validity of the statistical assumptions that are used to process the measurement data. A rigorous notation emphasizes this interpretation.},

The fuzzy approach proposed consists of representing measurements by a family of intervals of confidence stacked atop one another, that in fact define the upper bound of the probability distributions consistent with these intervals of confidence. This approach is compatible with the ISO Guide for the expression of uncertainty in measurement, and is particularly interesting because it allows both the handling of specificity and uncertainty of measurement. Moreover, fuzzy uncertainty propagation is available thanks to fuzzy arithmetic, which is a generalization of interval analysis, yielding both worst case results and best estimates at the same time. In order to simplify the propagation, a parameterized possibility distribution approximating the optimal one is proposed and compared with the probabilistic approaches.},

Measurement is defined as the estimation of numerical relations (or ratios) between magnitudes of a quantitative attribute and a unit. The history of scientific measurement, from antiquity to the present may be interpreted as revealing a progressive deepening in the understanding of this position. First, the concept of ratio was broadened to include ratios between incommensurable magnitudes; second, the concept of a quantitative attribute was broadened to include non-extensive quantities; third, quantitative structure and its relations to ratios and real numbers were elaborated; and finally, the issue of empirically distinguishing between quantitative and non-quantitative structures was addressed. This interpretation of measurement understands it in a way that is continuous with scientific investigation in general, i.e., as an attempt to discover independently existing facts.},

It describes an approximate method to calculate the measurement uncertainty in nearly all areas of metrology. In this way it overcomes the various limitations and drawbacks of the uncertainty propagation detailed in GUM. However, GS1 demands a software implementation in contrast to the uncertainty propagation. Therefore we have developed a software tool called MUSE (Measurement Uncertainty Simulation and Evaluation), which is a comprehensive implementation of GS1. In this paper we present the major computational aspects of the software which are the sampling from probability density functions (PDFs), an efficient way to propagate the PDFs with the help of a block design through the equation of the measurand and the calculation of the summarizing parameters based on these blocks. Also the different quality measures which are in place during the life cycle of the tool are elaborated.},

  abstract = {A comparison of the text of VIM recent III Edition with that of the GUM and of its contemporary VIM II Edition alights significant differences in the definition of basic measurement terms in the two documents, and with respect to the basic written standards in the field of testing, ISO 5725 and ISO 3534. The paper intends to introduce author's interpretation of these \textendash{} and companion \textendash{} texts, concerning specifically the terminology and the statistical treatment of the influence quantities and of the effects of their variability (in time and standard-to-standard), either related to replicated measurements performed on a single standard (standard `reproducibility') or to the comparisons of different standards, thus involving the concept of `accuracy' and its estimate, and consequently directly relevant to traceability. Another question that arose a few years ago was whether different types of measurand could be the consequence of the different intrinsic nature of different types of standards. It prompted an analysis that resulted in the proposal of considering two distinct `classes' of standards. These classes require different answers to the issue of the treatment of systematic effects. The distinction is relevant, in particular, to the statistical treatment of comparison data, which form the basis of the traceability assessment. The paper is presenting a discussion on the implications of the above distinction, concentrating on cases where systematic effects are dominating the experimental results, a common case in several metrology fields, and on ways to tackle the problem of the correction required by the GUM for standards of class 2 (standards whose values are accurate measures of a common measurand) \textendash{} a class often not recognised in the general literature.},

Numerical simulations are performed in the case of (uncorrelated) heteroskedastic measurements of the real and imaginary parts. The two estimators are compared by studying the behaviour of their variances and MSEs, and some guidance is given on the best choice between the two, depending on the specific experimental context. First and second-order approximations for their variance, hence for the uncertainty associated with the estimates they produce, are also provided in a more general case, that is, for correlated and heteroskedastic measurements of the real and imaginary parts. Examples from the metrological and the physical fields are given in order to compare the estimators on actual data.},

This new method based on RFV allows us to take into explicit account and to properly manage systematic effects and complete ignorance contributions to uncertainty. For all three methods, concise and schematic procedures are presented in order to give a clear comparison among them and to ease implementation. Particular attention is focused on how uncertainty can be expressed and propagated in an indirect measurement through a mathematical model. Furthermore, this paper proposes a generalized method to express and propagate uncertainty by means of RFV. This proposed method is characterized by its applicability to any type of mathematical model, even if it comprises complex numerical functions or algorithms.},

In particular, I will discuss work by Sergei Bernstein that is closely related to Cox's but has been neglected by Cox and his commentators. Before reviewing Bernstein's work, I will discuss the context of Cox's work and explain why it did not dissuade me from studying alternative representations of uncertainty.

  abstract = {It is recommended in the internationally adopted standard GUM that the measurement result of a measurand Y , determined from input quantities through a known functional relationship, should be reported as an uncertainty interval with a specific level of confidence. The uncertainty intervals discussed in GUM are evaluated by assuming that the measurements of Y follow a normal or t distribution. However, in practice, the resulting measurements of Y tend to follow an asymmetric distribution. This communication reviews some generalized univariate distributions that can be fitted to the measurements of Y based on its shape in terms of its coefficients of skewness and kurtosis. The uncertainty interval of the measurand is then evaluated from the fitted distribution. Examples are given to illustrate the use of these distributions in evaluating the expanded uncertainty in measurement.},

The paper notes (i) the resulting lack of invariance of measurement results to nonlinear reparametrizations of the measurement problem, (ii) the potential undetected divergence of measurement estimates obtained by Monte Carlo evaluation, (iii) the potential failure of the methodology to give uncertainty intervals enclosing the values of the measurands with an acceptable frequency and (iv) the potential loss of measurement precision. The distributed-measurand concept is gaining popularity partly because of its association with analysis using the Monte Carlo principle. However, the Monte Carlo principle is also applicable without adopting the distributed-measurand concept.

The 'validity' of a method of generating intervals of measurement uncertainty is identified principally with the frequency with which these intervals contain the measurand. Two approaches to the evaluation of such intervals are described, and their performances are compared for the simple measurement function appearing in Hall's paper. The first is a Bayesian approach, which is consistent with the numerical method described in Supplement 1 to the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement . The second is an approach based on frequentist principles. Simulations with fixed values of the unknown parameters are conducted to find the rate at which the methods generate intervals containing the value of the measurand and to find the mean widths of the intervals produced. The results show that the standard Bayesian procedure and its modifications can perform poorly. In contrast, the frequentist procedure achieves the required rate of 0.95 while generating intervals of similar width.},

This paper describes (i) how the output distribution of a Monte Carlo (MC) evaluation of uncertainty can be summarized for use in another analysis and (ii) how a general probability distribution can be summarized for efficient use as an MC input distribution. The principal technique discussed involves fitting an asymmetric form of 'lambda distribution' to the summarizing data. This distribution is defined by the inverse of its distribution function, so the generation of random samples from this distribution is straightforward. The inverse of the distribution function is known as the 'quantile function'. The principle advocated is that of working with distributions with convenient quantile functions instead of distributions with convenient probability density functions. This principle is applicable whether the distributions represent sampling distributions, as in frequentist statistics, or patterns of belief, as in Bayesian statistics.},

In other situations, the number of input or output quantities might be large and information about dependence might not be recorded because of the apparent need for the construction of a large matrix of covariances.

This paper identifies an apparent internal inconsistency arising with the full procedure described in the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement . The phenomenon occurs when the measurand is expressible as a function of quantities with common sources, and is related to the calculation of an effective number of degrees of freedom. One common situation in which this inconsistency arises is where a point on a line is measured using estimates of the intercept and slope derived from the same dataset; the numbers of degrees of freedom obtained differ according to whether this point is measured directly from the dataset or from the estimates of the intercept and slope. An example is given where the widths of the corresponding expanded uncertainty intervals differ by a factor of approximately 2. Statistical principles explaining this issue are discussed, and a principle for the calculation of an effective number of degrees of freedom is proposed.},

The material is presented to clarify assumptions underlying the techniques, to highlight differences between the techniques and to point to difficulties associated with applying the techniques under current views of 'uncertainty analysis'. Considerable attention is given to the estimation of values of the function and not just to the estimation of parameters of the function. The paper gives a summary of many results of least-squares fitting, including some unfamiliar results for the simultaneous estimation of the unknown function at all points. On many occasions the unknown function will only be approximately linear, in which case we must define a unique unknown gradient to give proper meaning to our 'estimate' of slope. This can be achieved by defining an interval of interest and then applying a least-squares-type result.},

One suggests that knowing the data to be digitized increases uncertainty while the other might be thought to imply the opposite. This issue is clarified and relevant concepts are discussed. This discussion leads to the development of a new approximation relating to the uncertainty of an estimate obtained by taking the mean of a set of digital measurement results. This result is consistent with others published recently in implying that resolution error can usually be ignored in such a situation. The solution to this problem obtained in a Bayesian analysis with the usual non-informative prior distribution is shown to give an inappropriate result when all the observations are equal and to exhibit anomalous behaviour in certain other circumstances.

The estimate with p = 2 is the familiar sample mean. Assumptions that are relevant when preferring an estimate with p $<$ 2 are identified and examined. Theoretical considerations and results of simulations weaken the case for choosing an estimate with p $<$ 2. The simulation results support the regular use of the sample mean or an estimate that involves the value p = 1.5 when the kurtosis of the dataset is sufficiently large.},

  abstract = {If measurement uncertainty is to be expressed by forming a distribution of belief for the measurand then this should be reflected in the theory underlying the analysis of interlaboratory comparison data. This paper presents a corresponding method for the calculation of a reference value in a comparison where each laboratory independently assigns a probability density function, f i ( x ), to the value X of a stable artefact. Straightforward argument shows that a consensus density function for X can be taken as \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0026-1394/43/1/002/metro207092in001.gif] f(x)=$\backslash$prod\_i=1\^n f\_i(x)/{\i}nt $\backslash$prod\_i=1\^n f\_i(x)$\backslash$,$\backslash$rmd x , assuming that the densities of the n laboratories are reliable and mutually consistent. A method is also presented for examining this consistency. The result f ( x ) is a special case of a consensus in the statistical literature called the logarithmic opinion pool. The key comparison reference value might be taken as the mean, median or mode of f ( x ). The method developed does not explicitly involve laboratory biases (offsets), which are important features of most methods for comparison analysis published recently and which are relevant to the calculation of degrees of equivalence. The belief approach does not seem well-suited when it is assumed that such offsets exist.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the purposes of CIPM key comparisons and presents a model-based analysis that is in keeping with these purposes. Measures of 'operability' and 'interoperability' are derived to answer the reasonable questions 'how accurate will the result be when the laboratory in question makes some measurement in the future?' and 'how similar would the results be if two laboratories were to make a common measurement in the future?' These are explicit questions that relate to the concepts of measurement ability and the equivalence of standards. The basic concepts emphasized are that (i) a measurement result cannot legitimately contribute to its own point of reference and that (ii) the effects causing error, or uncertainty, that are relevant in forming the measures of operability and interoperability are those that vary after the key comparison. Therefore, points of references for each measurement result are formed by excluding the result in question, and the measures of operability and interoperability are defined using the uncertainty components with effects varying on the short time-scale. These measures have clear and communicable meanings.},

  title = {A Procedure for the Evaluation of Measurement Uncertainty Based on Moments},
  volume = {42},
  abstract = {A practical, transparent and accurate procedure is proposed for the evaluation of measurement uncertainty. The procedure is based on established statistical theory, allows the treatment of correlated input quantities estimated from a finite number of observations and permits the assignment of asymmetric distributions to input quantities. The procedure is applicable wherever the basic method of clause 8 of the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (the Guide ) is applicable. As in the method of the Guide , distributions are associated with input quantities for use with a linearized formulation of the measurement function. These distributions are combined using a property of their statistical cumulants, which are simple functions of their moments. The distribution ultimately obtained for the measurand is a member of the Pearson family, which has the set of scaled t -distributions as a subset. So the procedure allows greater flexibility than the method of the Guide in the representation of the distribution associated with the measurand. The procedure has the qualities of internal consistency and transferability as outlined in clause 0.4 of the Guide and is consistent with principles of the 'propagation of distributions' that underlie a proposed supplement to the Guide . In many cases it will permit the quotation of uncertainty intervals that are narrower than those of the Guide yet with the same justifiable probability of containing the measurand, so providing a more informative statement to the user of the interval. The procedure is presented for the probabilities of 0.95 and 0.99 but can be extended to accommodate other probabilities.},

It is shown that simple sequential adaptive Monte Carlo schemes may not perform well in this regard and an alternative method based on a two-stage procedure due to Stein is proposed.

  abstract = {In the referenced paper, Ian Mills addresses the confusion caused by the treatment of plane angle in the International System of Units (SI). As he points out, what the SI calls an `angle' is not a dimensional physical quantity but, rather, the dimensionless numerical value of the angle when expressed in radians, thus creating widespread confusion regarding terminology and notation. For example, Mills shows that for the harmonic oscillator, if the conventional argument of the sinusoid represents an angle, it must be divided by a dimensional constant equal to one radian in order to correctly render it dimensionless, thereby greatly clarifying the notation. However, there is a problem with the author's interpretation of frequency. Although, for uniform rotation, Mills correctly defines the revolution frequency as the number of complete revolutions, N , divided by the time interval, he takes the unit for N to be `cycle' (which he defines as one revolution) rather than the correct unit: the number one. The unit for `frequency' then appears to be `cycle per second' (i.e. revolution per second), whereas it should be one per second, correctly called hertz. Thus Mills concludes that `frequency' is the same physical quantity as angular velocity and calls for the `hertz' to be redefined as 2 $\pi$ rad s -1 , a non-coherent derived unit for angular velocity. This misinterpretation of frequency corrupts the remainder of the author's discussion of the examples considered. In my comment, I explain and correct these and related errors.},

Here we present results of the lowest 200 m of the Dome C ice core, extending the record of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration by two complete glacial cycles to 800,000 yr before present. From previously published data and the present work, we find that atmospheric carbon dioxide is strongly correlated with Antarctic temperature throughout eight glacial cycles but with significantly lower concentrations between 650,000 and 750,000 yr before present. Carbon dioxide levels are below 180 parts per million by volume (p.p.m.v.) for a period of 3,000 yr during Marine Isotope Stage 16, possibly reflecting more pronounced oceanic carbon storage. We report the lowest carbon dioxide concentration measured in an ice core, which extends the pre-industrial range of carbon dioxide concentrations during the late Quaternary by about 10 p.p.m.v. to 172\textendash{}300 p.p.m.v.},

By viewing the parameters for the inverse problem as realizations for a random variable we are able to use standard results from probability theory to formulate a tractable probabilistic framework to treat this uncertainty. We discuss method stability and approximate problems and are able to show convergence of solutions of the approximate problems to those of the original problem. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated in numerical examples involving estimation of constant parameters in differential equations.},

  abstract = {The statistical tests used in the analysis of structural equation models with unobservable variables and measurement error are examined. A drawback of the commonly applied chi square test, in addition to the known problems related to sample size and power, is that it may indicate an increasing correspondence between the hypothesized model and the observed data as both the measurement properties and the relationship between constructs decline. Further, and contrary to common assertion, the risk of making a Type II error can be substantial even when the sample size is large. Moreover, the present testing methods are unable to assess a model's explanatory power. To overcome these problems, the authors develop and apply a testing system based on measures of shared variance within the structural model, measurement model, and overall model.},

As an alternative to this {\^a}\texteuro{\oe}total variance{\^a}\texteuro\dbend{} (TV) method, {\^a}\texteuro{\oe}effective variance{\^a}\texteuro\dbend{} (EV) methods convert the uncertainty in x into an effective contribution to that in y, and though easier to use are considered to be less reliable. There are at least two EV methods, differing in how the weights are treated in the optimization. One of these is identical to the TV method for fits to a straight line. The formal differences among these methods are clarified, and Monte Carlo simulations are used to examine the statistical properties of each on the widely used straight-line model of York, a quadratic variation on this, Orear's hyperbolic model, a nonlinear binding (Langmuir) model, and Wentworth's kinetics model. The simulations confirm that the EV and TV methods are statistically equivalent in the limit of small data error, where they yield unbiased, normally distributed parameter estimates, with standard errors correctly predicted by the a priori covariance matrix. With increasing data error, these properties fail to hold; and the TV method is not always statistically best. Nonetheless, the method differences should seldom be of practical significance, since they are likely to be small compared with uncertainties from incomplete information about the data error in x and y.},

  abstract = {A minimal extension of the standard model (SM) with a single new mass scale and providing a complete and consistent picture of particle physics and cosmology up to the Planck scale is presented. We add to the SM three right-handed SM-singlet neutrinos, a new vectorlike color triplet fermion, and a complex SM-singlet scalar $\sigma$ that stabilizes the Higgs potential and whose vacuum expectation value at $\sim$1011 GeV breaks lepton number and a Peccei-Quinn symmetry simultaneously. Primordial inflation is produced by a combination of $\sigma$ (nonminimally coupled to the scalar curvature) and the SM Higgs boson. Baryogenesis proceeds via thermal leptogenesis. At low energies, the model reduces to the SM, augmented by seesaw-generated neutrino masses, plus the axion, which solves the strong CP problem and accounts for the dark matter in the Universe. The model predicts a minimum value of the tensor-to-scalar ratio r$\simeq$0.004, running of the scalar spectral index $\alpha\simeq$-7\texttimes{}10-4, the axion mass mA$\sim$100 $\mu$eV, and cosmic axion background radiation corresponding to an increase of the effective number of relativistic neutrinos of $\sim$0.03.

It can be shown that the cross spectrum between two variables can be decomposed into two parts, each relating to a single causal arm of a feedback situation. Measures of causal lag and causal strength can then be constructed. A generalisation of this result with the partial cross spectrum is suggested.},

Given the joint distribution on all these variables, the DAG contains all information about how intervening on one variable changes the distribution of the other n-1n-1n-1 variables. However, quantifying the causal influence of one variable on another one remains a nontrivial question. Here we propose a set of natural, intuitive postulates that a measure of causal strength should satisfy. We then introduce a communication scenario, where edges in a DAG play the role of channels that can be locally corrupted by interventions. Causal strength is then the relative entropy distance between the old and the new distribution. Many other measures of causal strength have been proposed, including average causal effect, transfer entropy, directed information, and information flow. We explain how they fail to satisfy the postulates on simple DAGs of $\leq$3$\leq$3$\backslash$leq3 nodes. Finally, we investigate the behavior of our measure on time-series, supporting our claims with experiments on simulated data.},

We propose that the radian can be seen as an independent unit whose dimensional status is modified in the SI and other unit systems for this purpose. This framework clarifies how different unit systems are interrelated, and identifies the key pieces of information that are needed to define both a unit system and the equations that are to be used with it. Specifically, these are the size of the base units in the unsimplified system, together with sufficient equations to identify all the conventions adopted by the particular unit system. The appropriate extra information for the revised SI is presented. We do not propose that the treatment of angles as dimensionless within the SI is changed. It is also proposed that the Gaussian unit system is best seen as identical to cgs-es, but with the B and H symbols in equations used to represent `relativistic' versions of B and H , which should properly be treated as different quantities to the non-relativistic versions. The relativistic versions of B and H can similarly be used within the SI, with many of the advantages of the Heaviside\textendash{}Lorentz system.},

The unit system used for teaching, the SI, is instead designed primarily to be a set of units that can be applied consistently across all areas of science, commerce and industry. The SI also gives priority to emphasising the distinction between different quantities, by (most of the time) giving different units to different quantities, rather than producing the simplest possible equations. It is not widely appreciated that the SI treats the radian as the natural unit for angle, the only unit to be treated this way, with consequent issues for clear distinctions between quantities involving angles. The system that the SI would become if this anomaly were removed is presented. Rather than advocating this major change to the SI itself, it is proposed to highlight the existence of the underlying system to clarify how angles are handled physics, to make it easier to include angles in software calculations, and as an example of how the choice of unit system affects the equations we use.},

"Number of entities" is dimensionally independent of the current base quantities and should take its rightful place among them. The corresponding base unit is "one". A working definition is given. Other quantities of dimension one are derived as fraction, ratio, efficiency, relative quantity, relative increment or characteristic number and may also use the unit "one", whether considered to be base or derived. The special term 'uno' and symbol 'u' in either case are proposed, allowing combination with SI prefixes.},

I draw attention to the need to carefully distinguish the names and symbols for quantities from the names and symbols for their numerical values in any application, and the significance of including units such as radian and cycle for the quantity plane angle. The familiar equations for a harmonic oscillator such as $\omega$ = 2 $\pi\nu$ , and the relation ${\Elzxh}$ = h /2 $\pi$ for the Planck constant, are shown to hold only if the symbols are taken to represent the dimensionless numerical values of the quantities concerned in particular units, rather than the actual values which are not dimensionless as generally used in the equations of physics. Alternative ways of handling these quantities and units are discussed.},

  abstract = {For the determination of the Avogadro constant by the x-ray crystal density method, an accurate volume measurement of 1 kg Si spheres is of primary importance. For this purpose, an optical interferometer was improved and used to measure the volumes of two 1 kg silicon spheres which were manufactured from a silicon crystal highly enriched in 28 Si. The apparent volumes of the spheres, which do not take into account the influence of the surface layers on the volume measurement by interferometry, were determined with a relative standard uncertainty of as small as 2.0 \texttimes{} 10 -8 . The surface of the spheres was characterized by using an improved spectroscopic ellipsometer. By considering the influence of the surface layers, the core volumes of the spheres, which exclude the surface layers, were determined. These results were used for the determination of the Avogadro constant in 2015 as a framework organized by the International Avogadro Coordination project. This paper provides details on the measurements, the improvements made to the apparatus, the data analysis and the uncertainty evaluation.},

I present a set of existence and impossibility results concerning inference devices. These results hold independent of the precise physical laws governing our universe. In a limited sense, the impossibility results establish that Laplace was wrong to claim that even in a classical, non-chaotic universe the future can be unerringly predicted, given sufficient knowledge of the present. Alternatively, these impossibility results can be viewed as a non-quantum mechanical "uncertainty principle". Next I explore the close connections between the mathematics of inference devices and of Turing Machines. In particular, the impossibility results for inference devices are similar to the Halting theorem for TM's. Furthermore, one can define an analog of Universal TM's (UTM's) for inference devices. I call those analogs "strong inference devices". I use strong inference devices to define the "inference complexity" of an inference task, which is the analog of the Kolmogorov complexity of computing a string. However no universe can contain more than one strong inference device. So whereas the Kolmogorov complexity of a string is arbitrary up to specification of the UTM, there is no such arbitrariness in the inference complexity of an inference task. I end by discussing the philosophical implications of these results, e.g., for whether the universe "is" a computer.},

  abstract = {The issues of mental causation, consciousness, and free will have vexed philosophers since Plato. In this book, Peter Tse examines these unresolved issues from a neuroscientific perspective. In contrast with philosophers who use logic rather than data to argue whether mental causation or consciousness can exist given unproven first assumptions, Tse proposes that we instead listen to what neurons have to say. Tse draws on exciting recent neuroscientific data concerning how informational causation is realized in physical causation at the level of NMDA receptors, synapses, dendrites, neurons, and neuronal circuits. He argues that a particular kind of strong free will and "downward" mental causation are realized in rapid synaptic plasticity. Such informational causation cannot change the physical basis of information realized in the present, but it can change the physical basis of information that may be realized in the immediate future. This gets around the standard argument against free will centered on the impossibility of self-causation. Tse explores the ways that mental causation and qualia might be realized in this kind of neuronal and associated information-processing architecture, and considers the psychological and philosophical implications of having such an architecture realized in our brains. \textcopyright{} 2013 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

  abstract = {Deep learning is a broad set of techniques that uses multiple layers of representation to automatically learn relevant features directly from structured data. Recently, such techniques have yielded record-breaking results on a diverse set of difficult machine learning tasks in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Despite the enormous success of deep learning, relatively little is understood theoretically about why these techniques are so successful at feature learning and compression. Here, we show that deep learning is intimately related to one of the most important and successful techniques in theoretical physics, the renormalization group (RG). RG is an iterative coarse-graining scheme that allows for the extraction of relevant features (i.e. operators) as a physical system is examined at different length scales. We construct an exact mapping from the variational renormalization group, first introduced by Kadanoff, and deep learning architectures based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). We illustrate these ideas using the nearest-neighbor Ising Model in one and two-dimensions. Our results suggests that deep learning algorithms may be employing a generalized RG-like scheme to learn relevant features from data.},

First the basic ideas of dynamical systems (fixed points, stability, etc.) are recalled, and an example of universality is discussed in this context: this is Feigenbaum's universality of the period doubling cascade for iterated maps on the interval. It is shown how renormalization ideas can be applied to explain universality and compute Feigenbaum's constants. Then, universality is presented in the scenario of quantum field theories, and studied by means of functional renormalization group equations, which allow for a close comparison with the case of dynamical systems. In particular, Wetterich equation for a scalar field is derived and discussed, and then applied to the computation of the Wilson-Fisher fixed point and critical exponent for the Ising universality class. References to more advanced topics and applications are provided.},

The average information loss under a single step of Wilsonian RG transformation is evaluated as a conditional entropy of the fast variables, which are integrated out, when the slow ones are held fixed. Its positivity results in the monotonic decrease of the informational entropy under renormalization. This, however, does not necessarily imply the irreversibility of the RG flow, because the entropy explicitly depends on the total number of degrees of freedom, which is reduced. Only some size-independent additive part of the entropy could possibly provide the required Lyapunov function. We also introduce a mutual information of fast and slow variables as probably a more adequate quantity to represent the changes in the system under renormalization and evaluate it for some simple systems. It is shown that for certain real space decimation transformations the positivity of the mutual information directly leads to the monotonic growth of the entropy per lattice site along the RG flow and hence to its irreversibility.},

Use of such features in Pre-Scheme programs is restricted to those cases that can be compiled into efficient code. Type reconstruction is done using a modified Hindley/Milner algorithm that allows overloaded user-defined functions. All top-level forms in Pre-Scheme programs are evaluated at compile time, which gives the user additional control over the compiler's partial evaluation of a program.

Active capsules at one level make predictions, via transformation matrices, for the instantiation parameters of higher-level capsules. When multiple predictions agree, a higher level capsule becomes active. We show that a discrimininatively trained, multi-layer capsule system achieves state-of-the-art performance on MNIST and is considerably better than a convolutional net at recognizing highly overlapping digits. To achieve these results we use an iterative routing-by-agreement mechanism: A lower-level capsule prefers to send its output to higher level capsules whose activity vectors have a big scalar product with the prediction coming from the lower-level capsule.},

  abstract = {The greater ubiquity of robots creates a need for generic guidelines for robot behaviour. We focus less on how a robot can technically achieve a predefined goal, and more on what a robot should do in the first place. Particularly, we are interested in the question how a heuristic should look like which motivates the robot's behaviour in interaction with human agents. We make a concrete, operational proposal as to how the information-theoretic concept of empowerment can be used as a generic heuristic to quantify concepts such as self-preservation, protection of the human partner and responding to human actions. While elsewhere we studied involved single-agent scenarios in detail, here we present proof-of-principle scenarios demonstrating how empowerment interpreted in light of these perspectives allows one to specify core concepts with a similar aim as Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics in an operational way. Importantly, this route does not depend on having to establish an explicit verbalized understanding of human language and conventions in the robots. Also, it incorporates the ability to take into account a rich variety of different situations and types of robotic embodiment.},

  title = {Derivation of {{Principle}} of {{Extreme Physical Information}}},
  abstract = {The unknown amplitude law q(x) defining an observed effect may be found using the principle of Extreme Physical Information. EPI is derived as follows. The observations follow an information flow J --$>$ I, with J the information intrinsic to the source and I the Fisher information level in its data, obeying (i) I=4 Integral dx q' -squared. Here q'= dq/dx and p(x) = q(x)-squared is the probability. It was previously shown, using L. Hardy's 5 axioms defining physics, that I = max. Therefore, its variation (ii) delta I = 0. Note that I is generic, obeying (i) for all source effects, whereas J is specific to the particular effect. Hence, rather than having form (i), J obeys (iii) J = Integral dx j[q(x),s(x)] with j some function of its arguments and s(x) a known source, such as of mass, biological fitness, etc. Information I decreases under any irreversible operation such as measurement, so that I l.e. J or, equivalently, I = kJ where 0 l.e. k l.e. 1. Then the variation delta I = k delta J so that property (ii) gives (iv) delta J = 0 as well. Then combining (ii) and (iv), delta(I - J) = 0. Or, I - J = L = extremum. What kind of extremum? Eqs. (i) and (iii) give (v) L=4q'\^2 - j[q(x),s(x)]. Differentiating (v), (d\^2 L )/(dq'\^2) = +8. Then by the Legendre condition the extremum is a minimum. The unknown source effect obeys (vi) I - J= minimum, EPI.},

Let p(x,u) be the unknown joint PDF (probability density function) on position- and momentum fluctuations x,u for a pure state particle. Suppose that the phase part Psi(x,z) of its Fourier transform F.T.[p(x,u)]=|Z(x,z)|exp[iPsi(x,z)] is constructed as a hologram. (Such a hologram is often used in heterodyne interferometry.) Consider a particle randomly illuminating this phase hologram. Let its two position coordinates be measured. Require that the measurements contain an extreme amount of Fisher information about true position, through variation of the phase function Psi(x,z). The extremum solution gives an output PDF p(x,u) that is the convolution of the Wigner p\_\{W\}(x,u) with an instrument function defining uncertainty in either position x or momentum u. The convolution arises naturally out of the approach, and is one-dimensional, in comparison with the two-dimensional convolutions usually proposed for coarse graining purposes. The output obeys positivity, as required of a PDF, if the one-dimensional instrument function is sufficiently wide. The result holds for a large class of systems: those whose amplitudes a(x) are the same at their boundaries (Examples: states a(x) with positive parity; with periodic boundary conditions; free particle trapped in a box).},

  abstract = {An exponential family or mixture family of probability distributions has a natural hierarchical structure. This paper gives an ``orthogonal'' decomposition of such a system based on information geometry. A typical example is the decomposition of stochastic dependency among a number of random variables. In general, they have a complex structure of dependencies. Pairwise dependency is easily represented by correlation, but it is more difficult to measure effects of pure triplewise or higher order interactions (dependencies) among these variables. Stochastic dependency is decomposed quantitatively into an ``orthogonal'' sum of pairwise, triplewise, and further higher order dependencies. This gives a new invariant decomposition of joint entropy. This problem is important for extracting intrinsic interactions in firing patterns of an ensemble of neurons and for estimating its functional connections. The orthogonal decomposition is given in a wide class of hierarchical structures including both exponential and mixture families. As an example, we decompose the dependency in a higher order Markov chain into a sum of those in various lower order Markov chains},

  abstract = {Four estimators of the directed information rate between a pair of jointly stationary ergodic finite-alphabet processes are proposed, based on universal probability assignments. The first one is a Shannon--McMillan--Breiman type estimator, similar to those used by Verd$\backslash$'u (2005) and Cai, Kulkarni, and Verd$\backslash$'u (2006) for estimation of other information measures. We show the almost sure and \$L\_1\$ convergence properties of the estimator for any underlying universal probability assignment. The other three estimators map universal probability assignments to different functionals, each exhibiting relative merits such as smoothness, nonnegativity, and boundedness. We establish the consistency of these estimators in almost sure and \$L\_1\$ senses, and derive near-optimal rates of convergence in the minimax sense under mild conditions. These estimators carry over directly to estimating other information measures of stationary ergodic finite-alphabet processes, such as entropy rate and mutual information rate, with near-optimal performance and provide alternatives to classical approaches in the existing literature. Guided by these theoretical results, the proposed estimators are implemented using the context-tree weighting algorithm as the universal probability assignment. Experiments on synthetic and real data are presented, demonstrating the potential of the proposed schemes in practice and the utility of directed information estimation in detecting and measuring causal influence and delay.},

  doi = {10.3934/jgm.2017014},
  abstract = {The space of probability densities is an infinite-dimensional Riemannian manifold, with Riemannian metrics in two flavors: Wasserstein and Fisher--Rao. The former is pivotal in optimal mass transport (OMT), whereas the latter occurs in information geometry---the differential geometric approach to statistics. The Riemannian structures restrict to the submanifold of multivariate Gaussian distributions, where they induce Riemannian metrics on the space of covariance matrices. Here we give a systematic description of classical matrix decompositions (or factorizations) in terms of Riemannian geometry and compatible principal bundle structures. Both Wasserstein and Fisher--Rao geometries are discussed. The link to matrices is obtained by considering OMT and information geometry in the category of linear transformations and multivariate Gaussian distributions. This way, OMT is directly related to the polar decomposition of matrices, whereas information geometry is directly related to the \$QR\$, Cholesky, spectral, and singular value decompositions. We also give a coherent description of gradient flow equations for the various decompositions; most flows are illustrated in numerical examples. The paper is a combination of previously known and original results. As a survey it covers the Riemannian geometry of OMT and polar decompositions (smooth and linear category), entropy gradient flows, and the Fisher--Rao metric and its geodesics on the statistical manifold of multivariate Gaussian distributions. The original contributions include new gradient flows associated with various matrix decompositions, new geometric interpretations of previously studied isospectral flows, and a new proof of the polar decomposition of matrices based an entropy gradient flow.},

  doi = {10.1103/RevModPhys.67.605},
  abstract = {Although thermodynamic fluctuation theory originated from statistical mechanics, it may be put on a completely thermodynamic basis, in no essential need of any microscopic foundation. This review views the theory from the macroscopic perspective, emphasizing, in particular, notions of covariance and consistency, expressed naturally using the language of Riemannian geometry. Coupled with these concepts is an extension of the basic structure of thermodynamic fluctuation theory beyond the classical one of a subsystem in contact with an infinite uniform reservoir. Used here is a hierarchy of concentric subsystems, each of which samples only the thermodynamic state of the subsystem immediately larger than it. The result is a covariant thermodynamic fluctuation theory which is plausible beyond the standard second-order entropy expansion. It includes the conservation laws and is mathematically consistent when applied to fluctuations inside subsystems. Tests on known models show improvements. Perhaps most significantly, the covariant theory offers a qualitatively new tool for the study of fluctuation phenomena: the Riemannian thermodynamic curvature. The thermodynamic curvature gives, for any given thermodynamic state, a lower bound for the length scale where the classical thermodynamic fluctuation theory based on a uniform environment could conceivably hold. Straightforward computation near the critical point reveals that the curvature equals the correlation volume, a physically appealing finding. The combination of the interpretation of curvature with a well-known proportionality between the free energy and the inverse of the correlation volume yields a purely thermodynamic theory of the critical point. The scaled equation of state follows from the values of the critical exponents. The thermodynamic Riemannian metric may be put into the broader context of information theory.},

Included are discussions of analytical and fluid dynamics, electromagnetism (in flat and curved space), thermodynamics, the deformation tensors of elasticity, soap films, special and general relativity, the Dirac operator and spinors, and gauge fields, including Yang-Mills, the Aharonov-Bohm effect, Berry phase, and instanton winding numbers, quarks, and the quark model for mesons. Before a discussion of abstract notions of differential geometry, geometric intuition is developed through a rather extensive introduction to the study of surfaces in ordinary space; consequently, the book should be of interest also to mathematics students. This book will be useful to graduate and advance undergraduate students of physics, engineering or mathematics. It can be used as a course text or for self-study. This third edition includes a new overview of Cartan's exterior differential forms. It previews many of the geometric concepts developed in the text and illustrates their applications to a single extended problem in engineering, namely the Cauchy stresses created by a small twist of an elastic cylindrical rod about its axis"--},

  abstract = {The Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) includes formulas that produce an estimate of a scalar output quantity that is a function of several input quantities, and an approximate evaluation of the associated standard uncertainty. This contribution presents approximate, Bayesian counterparts of those formulas for the case where the output quantity is a parameter of the joint probability distribution of the input quantities, also taking into account any information about the value of the output quantity available prior to measurement expressed in the form of a probability distribution on the set of possible values for the measurand. The approximate Bayesian estimates and uncertainty evaluations that we present have a long history and illustrious pedigree, and provide sufficiently accurate approximations in many applications, yet are very easy to implement in practice. Differently from exact Bayesian estimates, which involve either (analytical or numerical) integrations, or Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, the approximations that we describe involve only numerical optimization and simple algebra. Therefore, they make Bayesian methods widely accessible to metrologists. We illustrate the application of the proposed techniques in several instances of measurement: isotopic ratio of silver in a commercial silver nitrate; odds of cryptosporidiosis in AIDS patients; height of a manometer column; mass fraction of chromium in a reference material; and potential-difference in a Zener voltage standard.},

  abstract = {We use recent advances in the machine learning area known as 'reservoir computing' to formulate a method for model-free estimation from data of the Lyapunov exponents of a chaotic process. The technique uses a limited time series of measurements as input to a high-dimensional dynamical system called a 'reservoir'. After the reservoir's response to the data is recorded, linear regression is used to learn a large set of parameters, called the 'output weights'. The learned output weights are then used to form a modified autonomous reservoir designed to be capable of producing arbitrarily long time series whose ergodic properties approximate those of the input signal. When successful, we say that the autonomous reservoir reproduces the attractor's 'climate'. Since the reservoir equations and output weights are known, we can compute derivatives needed to determine the Lyapunov exponents of the autonomous reservoir, which we then use as estimates of the Lyapunov exponents for the original input generating system. We illustrate the effectiveness of our technique with two examples, the Lorenz system, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation. In particular, we use the Lorenz system to show that achieving climate reproduction may require tuning of the reservoir parameters. For the case of the KS equation, we note that as the system's spatial size is increased, the number of Lyapunov exponents increases, thus yielding a challenging test of our method, which we find the method successfully passes.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a general formulation of least-squares estimation using Lagrange multipliers. It is general in the sense that it takes into account the covariance matrix of all measured quantities and allows any known constraint to be imposed on the quantities being estimated. The technique may be used to estimate parameters of a calibration curve for a transducer taking into account the uncertainty and correlation coefficients of the measured stimuli and responses. It may also be used to adjust measured fundamental constants to a coherent set obeying the appropriate physical laws.},

Two algorithms are presented in matrix notation, which can handle the general case where all input quantities are uncertain. Attention is paid to the consistency of the adjustment. Two examples show that the algorithms exhibit comparable performances.},

  abstract = {The determination of a best-fit calibration curve that describes the response of a measuring system to the value of a standard is one of the most widely used procedures in metrology. The mathematical basis for a generalized least-squares solution to this problem is reviewed. Examples of the application of a software implementation of the method are presented to illustrate the treatment of calibration problems with different uncertainty structures for the calibration data, including correlated data. The examples concern the calibration of analysers to measure the composition of natural gas and the calibration of a gas flow dilutor.},

  abstract = {Application of least-squares as, for instance, in curve fitting is an important tool of data analysis in metrology. It is tempting to employ the supplement 1 to the GUM (GUM-S1) to evaluate the uncertainty associated with the resulting parameter estimates, although doing so is beyond the specified scope of GUM-S1. We compare the result of such a procedure with a Bayesian uncertainty analysis of the corresponding regression model. It is shown that under certain assumptions both analyses yield the same results but this is not true in general. Some simple examples are given which illustrate the similarities and differences between the two approaches.},
